Here’s a brief overview of the thread lifecycle:
-------------------------------------------------
New State: When a thread is created, it’s in the ‘New’ state. It has not yet started.

Runnable State: Once the thread is started using the start() method, it moves to the ‘Runnable’ state. Here, it might actually be running or ready to run, waiting for CPU allocation.

Blocked State: A thread can enter the ‘Blocked’ state when it’s waiting for a monitor lock to enter a synchronized block/method.

Waiting State: A thread enters the ‘Waiting’ state when it waits for another thread to perform a particular action, without any time limit.

Timed Waiting State: Similar to the ‘Waiting’ state, but with a specified waiting time. The thread is in this state when it calls methods like sleep() or wait() with a time-out parameter.

Terminated State: A thread enters the ‘Terminated’ state when it completes its execution or is forcibly terminated due to an exception.

New -> Runnable -> Blocked/Waiting/Timed Waiting -> Terminated


Each state is crucial for proper thread management and utilization of system resources. Understanding these states helps in writing efficient multi-threaded applications
