Process:
---------

A process is an instance of a program in execution. Itâ€™s a heavyweight operation because it has its own memory space, 
including the text section, data section, and other operating system resources1.

Processes are independent of each other and communicate through Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanisms1.

Context switching between processes is more time-consuming due to the associated overhead of saving and loading more state information1.


Thread:
--------

A thread is a segment of a process, meaning a process can have multiple threads, and these threads can execute concurrently1.

Threads within the same process share the same memory space, which makes communication between them more efficient but also means that a fault in one thread can affect the entire process1.

Context switching between threads is faster as they share the same memory and require less state information to be saved and loaded1.


Conclusion:
------------
In summary, processes are suitable for tasks that need to be isolated from each other, 
while threads are better for tasks that require shared memory for communication and quick context switches.
