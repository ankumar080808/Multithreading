Multitasking and multithreading are both concepts related to concurrent execution in computer systems, but they operate at different levels and have different implementations.

Multitasking:

Multitasking refers to the ability of an operating system to execute multiple tasks concurrently.

In multitasking, the CPU switches between different tasks rapidly, giving the illusion that multiple tasks are being executed simultaneously.

Tasks can be independent processes or threads running different programs.

Examples of multitasking include running a web browser while listening to music, or editing a document while downloading a file.

Multithreading:

Multithreading is a specific form of multitasking where multiple threads within a process execute concurrently.

Threads within the same process share the same memory space and resources, allowing them to communicate and coordinate more efficiently.

Multithreading is often used to improve the responsiveness of applications by allowing tasks to run in the background without blocking the main thread.

Examples of multithreading include a web browser rendering a webpage while simultaneously loading images in the background, or a video player decoding video frames while also handling user input.
In summary, multitasking refers to the ability of an operating system to execute multiple tasks concurrently, while multithreading is a technique used within a single process to achieve concurrent execution through the use of multiple threads
