The volatile and atomic constructs in Java are used in multithreading contexts to ensure thread safety when accessing and modifying variables shared across multiple threads. 

Use volatile when:
--------------------

You need to ensure that changes to a variable are visible to all threads. When a variable is declared volatile, the JVM ensures that every read of that variable will be from the main memory,
and not from the thread’s local cache, and every write to that variable will be to the main memory, not just to the thread’s local cache.


Use atomic variables when:
--------------------------

You need to perform atomic operations that go beyond the simple read and write, such as incrementing a number.
Classes in the java.util.concurrent.atomic package, like AtomicInteger or AtomicLong, provide methods for atomic operations without using synchronization.


Key differences to consider:
---------------------------------

volatile is a variable modifier that ensures visibility of changes to variables across threads1.

Atomic variables use low-level synchronization mechanisms to ensure that compound actions (like incrementing a value) are atomic, meaning they are executed as a single, indivisible operation1.

While volatile can ensure visibility, it does not guarantee atomicity for compound actions. Atomic variables guarantee both visibility and atomicity for the specific operations they support.


Volatile Variable Example: A volatile variable ensures that changes made in one thread are immediately visible to other threads.
It is used for variables that are accessed by multiple threads without synchronization.

public class VolatileCounter {
    private volatile int count = 0;

    public void increment() {
        count++;  // Direct write to volatile variable
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;  // Direct read from volatile variable
    }
}

In this example, the count variable is declared as volatile. This ensures that whenever a thread modifies count, the change is immediately reflected in the main memory, 
and other threads will see the updated value.

Atomic Variable Example: Atomic variables support lock-free, thread-safe operations on single variables. 
They are used when you need to perform atomic operations, which are operations that are completed in a single step from the perspective of other threads.

import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

public class AtomicCounter {
    private AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);

    public void increment() {
        count.incrementAndGet();  // Atomic operation
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count.get();  // Atomic read
    }
}


In this example, count is an AtomicInteger, which provides methods like incrementAndGet() that perform atomic increment operations. 
This means that the increment operation is done as a single, indivisible step, ensuring thread safety without using synchronized or Lock.

Both volatile and atomic variables are used to achieve thread safety, but they serve different purposesvolatile is suitable for cases where the operation is inherently atomic (like assigning or reading a variable), 
while atomic variables are necessary when performing compound operations (like incrementing a value) that must be executed atomically to maintain thread safety.


Guaranteeing atomicity means ensuring that a series of operations is treated as a single, indivisible unit, which either all succeed or none are applied. 
This is crucial in multi-threaded environments where operations on shared resources can be interleaved in ways that lead to inconsistent states.

import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

public class AtomicCounter {
    private AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);

    public void increment() {
        // This is an atomic operation, ensuring the increment is not interrupted
        count.incrementAndGet();
    }

    public int getCount() {
        // Atomic get operation, ensuring the true current value is returned
        return count.get();
    }
}

In this code, incrementAndGet() is an atomic operation provided by AtomicInteger. It increments the current value by one and returns the updated value. 
This operation is atomic, meaning that it acts as a single operation without the possibility of interference from other threads. No other thread can observe the count in an intermediate state; they will only see the value before or after the increment1


This contrasts with a non-atomic operation, where multiple steps (read, modify, write) are involved. Without atomicity, if two threads read the same value, 
increment it, and write it back, one increment could be lost, leading to an incorrect count
