Multithreading is a feature in Java that allows the concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program to maximize the utilization of the CPU.
Each part of the program that runs concurrently is called a thread, which is a lightweight process within a process.

The main reasons for using multithreading are:
-----------------------------------------------
Resource Utilization: Multithreading allows an application to run multiple threads simultaneously, making better use of the CPU resources.

Responsiveness: In user interface applications, multithreading can prevent the UI from freezing while performing background tasks2.

Performance: It can significantly improve the performance of an application, especially one that requires a lot of waiting or idle time, such as a network application.

Simplicity of Use: Writing a program that does several things simultaneously is often simpler and more intuitive than one that uses a complex state machine to switch between tasks.

Better Interaction: In server applications, multithreading can handle multiple client requests simultaneously, leading to better interaction and quicker response times.

Real-life examples of multithreading and multitasking are all around us, illustrating how these concepts are applied to improve efficiency and performance:

Smartphones: A classic example is our smartphones. While you talk on the phone, you can simultaneously download apps, receive notifications, and even navigate with GPS. Each of these tasks is handled by a separate thread in the smartphone’s operating system1.

Banking Systems: When you perform a transaction, such as withdrawing money from an ATM, the banking system uses multiple threads to handle different tasks concurrently. One thread may manage the communication with the ATM interface, while another sends a text message to your phone, and yet another sends an email notification of the transaction1.

Word Processors: A word processing program often checks the spelling and grammar of words in a document while you type. This is possible because each action—typing, spell checking, auto-formatting—is performed by separate threads running concurrently2.

Web Browsers: When you load a web page, the browser starts rendering the page while it is still downloading the rest of the content. This simultaneous processing allows for a faster and more seamless user experience. The rendering and downloading are handled by different threads2.

Media Players: Listening to music while working on other tasks is another example. The media player operates in a separate thread, allowing it to play music independently of other activities, such as typing a document or browsing the internet3.
